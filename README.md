# Transfert-style
Project for the class "Introduction to digital imagery" with Julie Delon (julie.delon@parisdescartes.fr) and Yann Gousseau (yann.gousseau@telecom-paristech.fr) from the MVA (Maths, Vision, Learning) Msc of University Paris-Saclay.

The project is based on the paper "A Neural algorithm for art style" of Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge published in September 2015.

For this project, I mainly rely on the VGG-19 pre-trained model from machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg on github (https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg). The work forked from github is located in the folder named "tensorflow-vgg". The weights of the CNNs can be found in the Readme.md of this very folder.
